## UT Austin Box Score Archival Project

Texas football's stats are all digitized, but not easily accessible. I fixed this with the goal of learning/practicing web scraping in python, data management and visualization, and introductory UI design in the process. The code is sloppy and disorganized, but I have learned so much in the process. This is not affiliated with UT.
